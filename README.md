# Maintenance Data Set - Explatory Data Analysis (EDA)
A beginner friendly EDA project applied on the synthetically created data set reflecting the real predictive maintenance practices encountered in the industry published by the University of California Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.

The EDA is applied using the fundamental Python functions to gather some insights about the relationships between the variables and failure types. The Jupyter Notebook ile contains some comments in Turkish; the code itself is pretty clean to understand without comments but Google Translate would be enough if needed. As this was a course homework there is also a presentation and a report(ish) - aslo in Turkish.
